Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

Amethyst uses two modifier combinations.

* `mod1` - `option + shift`
* `mod2` - `ctrl + option + shift`

And defines the following commands, mostly a mapping to xmonad key combinations.

* `mod1 + space` â€” cycle to next layout
* `mod2 + space` - cycle to previous layout
* `mod1 + l` - change layout to tall
* `mod1 + d` - change layout to wide
* `mod1 + -` - change layout to fullscreen
* `mod1 + z` - change layout to columns
* `mod1 + c` - focus 1st screen
* `mod1 + e` - focus 2nd screen
* `mod1 + r` - focus 3rd screen
* `mod2 + c` - move focused window to 1st screen
* `mod2 + e` - move focused window to 2nd screen
* `mod2 + r` - move focused window to 3rd screen
* `mod2 + [n]` - move focused window to nth space
* `mod1 + h` - shrink the main pane
* `mod1 + s` - expand the main pane
* `mod1 + v` - increase the number of windows in the main pane
* `mod1 + w` - decrease the number of windows in the main pane
* `mod1 + t` - focus the next window counterclockwise
* `mod1 + n` - focus the next window clockwise
* `mod2 + t` - move the focused window one space counterclockwise
* `mod2 + n` - move the focused window one space clockwise
* `mod1 + return` - swap the focused window with the main window
* `mod1 + m` - toggle whether or not the focused window is floating
* `mod1 + l` - display the current layout for each screen

Setting Up Spaces Support
-------------------------

Spaces are, unfortunately, not supported right out of the box. To enable it you
must activate Mission Control's keyboard shortcuts for switching to specific
Desktops, as Mac OS X calls them. This option is in the Keyboard Shortcuts tab
of the Keyboard preferences pane. The shortcuts will be of the form `ctrl +
[n]`. Amethyst is only able to send a window to the `n`th space if the shortcut
`ctrl + n` is enabled.
